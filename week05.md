Assignment Description
Final Project Contracts

Be sure to review the rubric in Canvas to see how you will be graded on this assignment. Please follow the rubric as you record your video to ensure you get all points covered.
Your assignment for this lesson will be 100% dedicated to your team project for this portion of the semester.
Create your crud endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for first two collections. Concentrate on error handling and validation as you implement these.
Create your Swagger API documentation that will be used for your project. Once these are in place, you can just write code until your Swagger doc can successfully execute these requests. It sets up a plan, an outline and a way to test your entire application.
Your Swagger documentation should be published to Render and available at the following route: /api-docs.
Each Team member document two individual contributions toward the weeks deliverables
Create a 5 to 8 minute video that goes through the items in Rubrics. Upload it to YouTube. This can be an done as an individual or as a team. If as a team the student must be present in the meeting the recording is taking place or a zero will be assigned. Videos longer than the alloted time will receive a zero and will be asked to resubmit.
Submit the following links in Canvas: GitHub repo, Render site, and YouTube video.
The team should use the same render and github repository throughout the team project for example: https://cse341-code-student.onrender.com//api-docs
