Your assignment for this lesson will be 100% dedicated to your team project for this portion of the semester.

Write at least four unit tests testing your GET endpoints in each collection.
Each Team member document two individual contributions toward the weeks deliverables
Your Swagger documentation should be published to Render and available at the following route: /api-docs.
Create a 5 to 8 minute video that goes through the items in Rubrics. Upload it to YouTube. This can be an done as an individual or as a team. If as a team the student must be present in the meeting the recording is taking place or a zero will be assigned. Videos longer than the alloted time will receive a zero and will be asked to resubmit.
Submit the following links in Canvas: GitHub repo, Render site, and YouTube video.
The team should use the same render and github repository throughout the team project for example: https://cse341-code-student.onrender.com//api-docs
Assignment Description
Continue work on your team projects (keeping in mind the Week 07 Final project requirements). You will submit a status update in Canvas. Remember, you will complete and publish your projects next week.

Remember that you will need to write tests for each of your api endpoints. While testing is fresh on your mind from this week, now would be a good time to write tests for your API.
